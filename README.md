# Personal Portfolio Website

A simple portfolio website built to practice front-end development and showcase personal information, experience, and data visualizations.

## Purpose

The site serves as a personal homepage with sections for about, experience, education, and contact info. A separate page displays two SVG visualizations:
- A bar chart of “Taylor Swift Hate Level Distribution”
- A scatter/circle chart of “Dinner Response vs Tiredness Rating”

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for structure and accessibility
- **CSS3**: Responsive styling with modern layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid)
- **JavaScript**: Interactive functionality and DOM manipulation
